I was not “lost,” I was exploring.
If I fit, I sit.
Why do humans insist on touching me?
The red dot is my greatest enemy.
I meant to knock that over.
Feed me, then we’ll talk.
The dog is an idiot, but he’s my idiot.
I wasn’t staring, I was judging.
Why do doors exist? Remove them all.
I demand food, but not that food.
I see the bottom of my bowl… unacceptable!
If you touch my belly, you accept the consequences.
I will sit on whatever you’re using.
Why do humans make loud water?
If it moves, I must kill it.
The keyboard is my throne.
The world is my playground… and litter box.
You sleep when I allow it.
I hear food being opened—this concerns me.
The box is better than the gift inside.
I will walk across your face at 3 AM.
Sunspots belong to me.
My tail moves, and I must attack it.
The dog has no dignity.
I am majestic… until I fall off the couch.
Everything belongs to me.
If I break it, it was weak anyway.
My purpose? To be admired.
If I purr, you may stay.
Don’t touch me. Okay, touch me. Stop.
I was here first, act accordingly.
Why don’t humans land on their feet?
This is my house, you just pay for it.
You moved, so I must leave.
The dog is too happy. Suspicious.
My food? Too dry. Too wet. Too… something.
Your bed is now mine.
If I stare long enough, you’ll obey.
I saw a ghost. Or dust. Either way, I’m running.
I hear the can opener—this is urgent.
The only rule is there are no rules.
You are lucky to serve me.
I was never “lost,” I just didn’t answer.
Don’t tell me what to do.
I nap where I want.
Your coffee? Now my coffee.
The window is my TV.
Why does the dog listen to humans?
If I scratch it, it’s mine.
Laptops are just heated beds.
The vacuum is a demon.
I see a closed door. Unacceptable.
The dog exists? Unfortunate.
I will attack nothing for no reason.
Your leg? My new throne.
I demand pets, but only on my terms.
The couch arm is now my scratching post.
I see an empty lap. Fix this.
I don’t meow, I command.
The dog obeys, I rule.
I could help you, but I won’t.
You will never know what I’m thinking.
I sleep 16 hours a day because I deserve it.
There is a string. I must destroy it.
The ceiling fan is watching me.
If I swat it, it means I love it.
Your pillow? Also mine.
I will sit in the box you were about to use.
That food was my favorite… until today.
The bathtub is terrifying when wet.
I could knock this off the table… and I will.
I will never explain why I ran.
My paws must touch everything.
I heard the treat bag… give them to me.
My fur must be on everything.
If you leave, I ignore you. If you return, I ignore you harder.
The dog wags his tail? Pathetic.
I chase shadows because I am a warrior.
The best nap is in forbidden places.
I will make biscuits on your soul.
The sunbeam is too far. Carry me.
My purring means you’re doing something right.
I always land on my feet… except when I don’t.
I will fit into any space, no matter how small.
Your food smells interesting… let me taste it.
I am both predator and dramatic victim.
The dog drools? Disgusting.
No, I will not move.
I do not care about your personal space.
You left the house. Unforgivable.
I did something bad, but you’ll never know what.
You stopped petting me? Unacceptable.
I own you, not the other way around.
I love you, but at a distance.
I was asleep, but now I demand attention.
If I fit, I will loaf.
You will never find all my hiding spots.
I will scratch the expensive thing, not the cheap one.
That bug is in MY house? Time to attack.
I am the ruler of all I survey.
